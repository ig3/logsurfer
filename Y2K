 Year 2000 compliance
As far as the DFN-CERT is aware, the code constituting logsurfer should
present no problems with respect to year 2000 compliance. Logsurfer's
time and date functionality, i.e. the determination of time and date and
the conversion of time and date between formats is based the underlying
operating system's capabilities. The year 2000 compliance of the
software is therefore dependent on the host operating system as well as
the application's run-time environment.

 Disclaimer of warranty
Logsurfer is provided free of charge, and, therefore, on an "as is"
basis, without warranty of any kind, including without limitation the
warranties that it is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a
particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality
and performance of logsurfer is borne by the user. Should logsurfer
prove defective in any respect, the user and not DFN-CERT assumes the
entire cost of of any service and repair. No use of logsurfer is
authorized hereunder except under this disclaimer.

 Limitation of liability
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall
DFN-CERT be liable for any indirect, special, incidental or
consequential damages arising out of the use of or inability to use
logsurfer, including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other
commercial damages or losses, even if advised of the possibility
thereof, and regardless of the legal or equitable theory (contract, tort
or otherwise) upon which the claim is based.
